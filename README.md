## Inspiration

Do you love traveling but hate planning? Are you tired of spending countless hours researching activities, making reservations, and looking for inspiration from others? You‚Äôre not alone. In a single year, 750 million man-hours are spent on planning a trip to just Los Angeles. **Itineroo is the ultimate solution for travelers!** 

## How it Works - The Concept

Itineroo features an **explore page** you can look through for an itinerary that fits your preferences. After you find one, you can **'fork' it** and customize it to best suit your travels. You can also **create and share** your own travel itineraries with the community to help others plan their next adventure! 

Itineroo works like **social media** and even contains a **hub** for all 'hidden gem' TikToks, reels, and shorts. Never spend extra time looking for that hidden gem TikTok that you liked 3 weeks ago! We curate this hub and pull in videos from all platforms to ensure you have the best itinerary possible. 

Behind the scenes, we are currently working on an **AI bot** that will serve as a travel planning advisor‚Äîediting itineraries to your liking, providing links to book all your reservations, and recommending new experiences based on your preferences!

On the commercial side, Itineroo hopes to **partner with hotels** to minimize the 50 million dollars lost every day due to vacant rooms. That is, through Itineroo, hotels can trade discounts on vacant rooms for advertisements that reach a captive audience of travelers. Travelers will receive bookings at a much cheaper rate while hotels are using otherwise net losses to gain valuable marketing attention.

Whether you're looking for inspiration for your next trip or you want to share your experiences with others, Itineroo has everything you need. Plus, with the option to connect with fellow travelers and share tips and recommendations, you'll never feel alone on your journey. **Hop into your next adventure with Itineroo!**

## Who We Are

We‚Äôre a team of four college students‚Äîthree from UCLA and one from MIT. We plan to launch our idea very soon, and after the hackathon, we will continue iterating on our tech development and business model. 

### About Us

On campus, he is involved in Daily Bruin, The Bruin Group Consulting, and UCLA Men‚Äôs Ice Hockey. He loves to travel in his free time, with his most recent trip being spring break in Japan.

**Terry Kim** is currently studying computer science at MIT. He is passionate about using technology to unite people and maximize each individual‚Äôs impact on their community. In his free time, he enjoys outdoor activities, coffee, and traveling. Eventually, he hopes to travel full-time, hopefully with the help of Itineroo. 

**Krish Shah** is a computer engineering student at UCLA. He has worked for many companies as a full-stack developer with the most recent one being Happiest Baby. Traveling is his favorite thing to do, with his next trip being to Japan over the summer.

**Kenny Wan** is an ex-civil engineering turned computer science student at UCLA passionate about empowering communities around the world through technology,  software, and business.

He hopes to one day be able to travel around the world, exploring new places and meeting more people.

## What‚Äôs next for Itineroo?

We have big aspirations for Itineroo. We are launching our app on the app store next week and have surveyed interest from over **70 students!**. We are ecstatic to launch and help travelers and hotels across the world!

Looking forward, we want to continue adding exciting new features:
1.  An **AI bot** that will serve as a travel planning advisor‚Äîediting itineraries to your liking, providing links to book all your reservations, and recommending new experiences based on your preferences!

2. **GPS capabilities** to integrate recommendations for your explore page, giving you the most relevant local activities!

3. **Partnerships with hotels** to help our fellow travelers and hotels alike!
